Dependencies used:

- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup
- requests
- NLTK
- scikit-learn

To install python you must go to this website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and choose the one which corresponds to your OS (in my case I will be using windows).

For the next four dependencies all will be downloaded using CMD (Command Prompt), to open this you must press Windows + R, this will open the run window and then typing CMD.

To install the BeautifulSoup: "pip3 install beautifulsoup4" into CMD.

To install requests: "pip install requests".

To install NLTK: "pip install nltk" and afterwards go to an IDE of your choice (I used Visual Studio Code) and type nltk.download() and run the program.

To install scikit-learn: "pip3 install scikit-learn"
